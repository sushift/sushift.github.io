With so much free time lately, I've been trying to scan my negatives in order to share the photos digitally. At the same time, I've been trying to get higher resolution scans. Also, as I don't have a dedicated negative scanner or neither do I have a macro lens for my DSLR, I decided to improvise. That's why I bought a metalic extension tube for my Canon EOS T3i. What this tube does, is letting me use a non-macro lens to take macro photos. And it's actually, in just some aspects, better than an actual macro lens, as the abscence of lenses helps retaining quality when taking the photo.

However, it has it's caveats. Namely, you can't use the lens and macro tube combination for anything else than macro photography. It also has a very shallow depth of field, meaning that I can get only a plane of a few millimeters thick in focus at a time. But for the price of 17.50 US$ (14.900 CLP), it's a bargain.

So, my idea to start scanning, was taking a photograph of the negative filling the whole frame in my DSLR. For that, I used the extension tube numbered with a 2, getting pretty good results, but then I wanted to have even greater resolution scans. For that, I used all three extension tubes, increasing the magnification a __LOT__. But in order to scan the whole negative, I have to take pictures of different sections of the negative and then stitch them together.

So, on to the setup itself. What I use is my __DSLR__, the __extension tube__, an __iPad mini__ as light table (I know, far from ideal), a __tripod__ and __Photoshop__.

I start by positioning the camera and tripod in such a way, that the lens is perpendicular to my desk. Then I adjust the height of the tripod, so that the film can be in focus. I put the camera timer to 2 seconds, in order to prevent any shaking when pressing the shutter button. I then put the camera in live-view, so that I can adjust the film easily. Then it all comes down to taking the pictures. For this particular image, I took about 10 photographs. Is important to not let any light come in from the borders, as it can have a great impact on contrast and chromatic aberration.

As you can see from my previous image, there is a picture with a lot of light coming from the borders, which gave me a hard time when trying to stitch them all together. What I did was take all the RAWs and processing them in Photoshop. For the one with the light, I just cropped those borders from the image and saved them all in a folder.

Then I just click on File > Automate > Lens Correction and select all the processed images. This will output all lens-corrected images to a folder named results, in the same folder the original images where.

Now I have to stitch them all together, for that I go into File > Automate > Photomerge and select the PSD files that were just created. Make sure to untick 'Blend Images Together' and tick 'Geometric Distortion Correction'.

Finally, after some retouching I got something like this:

Now I have to blend all the layers together: Edit > Auto-Blend Layers and the following settings.

And I got this:

Which I can copy to another PSD and use the free-transform tool to adjust the edges and getting the final picture.

Finally I'm left with a HUGE scan, without many noticeable borders.
