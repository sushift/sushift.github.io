It's been just a few weeks, but the toll of social distancing is pretty real. Not being able to hangout out with friends or even hug my mother (she works at a hospital) is not a very nice feeling. But I find it curious that despite the hurt involved in all that, it's just gets kind of easier to do it each day. I'm not talking about getting used to it, but knowing that staying in quarantine is the way to protect not just the people around you, but everyone. And although it's not something confirmed, I'd like to talk about it anyways: Six degrees of separation.

This is a long known theory, originally written by Hungarian writer Frigyes Karinthy, author of _"Everything is different"_. In this volume of short stories, there is one called _"Chains"_, in which he explored the idea of a **"shrinking world"**, meaning that as technology advanced in terms of travel and communication, everyone was more connected to one another, effectively enalarging one's social circle. Because of this, the story's characters believed that there were no more than five acquaintances between any two people. 

>_"A fascinating game grew out of this discussion. One of us suggested performing the following experiment to prove that the population of the Earth is closer together now than they have ever been before. We should select any person from the 1.5 billion inhabitants of the Earth â€“ anyone, anywhere at all. He bet us that, using no more than five individuals, one of whom is a personal acquaintance, he could contact the selected individual using nothing except the network of personal acquaintances."_


<sup>Game invented by the characters based on the latter notion</sup>

There's also academic research, mainly in the context of computer science, that points to this exact notion being pretty much accurate. For example in 2007, a study was made using Windows Messenger, in which it was found that, between 240 million users, the average path length between every two users was 6. An study made using better algorithms in Twitter, found an average degree of separation between two users to be just 3.88.

In a more microscopic scale, there's also a game to link Kevin Bacon to any other actor through no more than 6 connections. Two actors are connected if they appeared in a movie or commercial together. As of September 2012, it's possible to search in Google for any given actor's _"Bacon number"_. That is, how many steps are needed to get to Kevin Bacon.

The purpose of this post is, I think, to highlight the importance of staying at home during the current global situation, as you're not only protecting yourselves and the people you hold dearest, but also someone, that even though you think you have no connection to, is closer to you than you think.
