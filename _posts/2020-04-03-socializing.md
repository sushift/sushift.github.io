The current social environment is very different. It's not us socializing with each other physically, like it's been the norm for pretty much always. And although it is nor will it be the first and last time, respectively, it will not last forever. And it still brings very interesting question to mind. And I'd like to elaborate about that in this particular post.

We as a society have to work together to restrain Covid-19's advance on the population, to try and reduce the number of people affected by the virus. **Together** is a very suitable word, although kind of ironic. The word **together** comes from the old English word _tog√¶dere_, meaning "to gather" so as to be present in one place, in an accumulated mass. That's why it's ironic. We have to fight this together, by not being together. We have to isolate ourselves to effectively fight this. We have to be **alone**.

Once again, the word **alone** comes from the Old English contraction of _all ana_, meaning **_all by oneself_**. But the more literal translation is actually **_wholly oneself_**. This means that this time could be something beneficial for us, to get to know oneself better. To make oneself **whole**.

Now, of course we also have the need to socialize with other people. And even though we can't be with each other physically, we can reach out to our family or friends through the wonders of social media. We can have a videocall or a simple phone call. We can use services such as Netflix, Spotify or YouTube alongside third-party websites that synchronize the content for two or more people, being able to hear or watch the same thing at the same time. We can play online games **together**. We can entertain ourselves, **together**.

And now this word has a whole different meaning. We can still be together, through social media and online communities. We can _"gather"_, digitally and make this something bearable. We as humans can adapt ourselves quite fast, and that's exactly what we are doing right now. We are socializing in a way that, for the moment, is the safest way to do so, because we have the means. So, stay strong and use your laptop, phone, desktop or any other digital device to keep socializing with people you care about, even if it's very different from before, the important part of socializing is the people, not the setting it takes place in.
