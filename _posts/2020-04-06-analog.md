Today I want to deviate myself a lot from the last two posts' theme. I'd like to talk a little about analog photography, and how it captivated me in a fairly simplistic manner. And to open on the subject I'd like you to read the following quote by French photographer Henri Cartier-Bresson.

>_To me, photography is the simultaneous recognition, in a fraction of a second, of the significance of an event._

<sup>Henri Cartier-Bresson</sup>

Cartier-Bresson is often mentioned as the greatest photographer of all time. And, personally, that seems to me quite and accurate description. He had many virtues as a photographer. He was able to frame what he had in mind perfectly, while at the same time recognizing that it was not enough with that. Sure, you could frame perfectly, but what good would it be for, if you had no subject, perhaps the most important part of his photographic work. He waited after composing and pressed the shutter just at the right time, in a mix of conscious control of the scene and subconscious realization of the **decisive moment**. A combination of knowledge and intuition.

And that's exactly what made him stand out as a photographer. The realization of this _decisive moment_ along with vast technical knowledge. There's a photograph that seems quite simple. Just a man riding his bike, the street he's on and a stair. From the top of this stair is that Henri Cartier-Bresson took the picture, fishing for the right moment. He had the photo already composed, but waited long enough for his subject to appear: the man riding his bike.

At first glance, the picture seems rather simple, but there was quite an amount of thought put into it. The stair spirals into the street, leading the eyes right to the cyclist, the same happens with the top hand rail, it points to the cyclist. The cyclist is positioned at the left of the frame, as to be _'exiting'_ the frame. The curve of the road brings certain dynamic to what would otherwise be a static photo.

And although it's a simple review of the photograph, I wanted to talk about it because that was one of the things that resonated with me. Being able to capture a moment. And although it can be done with a DSLR as well, it's just not the same. With a DSLR you have auto-focus, variable ISO for each photo, continuous shooting, etc. These features are amazing and very helpful when doing photography for _work_, in my opinion. But for me, there's something lost when using a DSLR, even though I use it a lot. And that is **permanence**.

While for digital photography permanence is usually the exception, for analog photography it is the norm. It has a different value to it, of a different nature. 

I usually take photos just once with my DSLR, trying to get it right the first time. But even then, when I upload the RAW to my computer and edit it with Lightroom, I find myself uploading the photo to my cloud, sharing it on Instagram and that's it. And if my HDD gets corrupt, I lose the photograph. Even if I have the Instagram 'backup', it's a scaled down JPEG from the original photo. Also, digital RAWs weight a lot. Around 24 MB each one, meaning that running out of HDD space is something that'll eventually happen.

But with analog photography, I can keep the negatives and enlarge whenever I want, the times I want. I can scan them to have them digitized and re-scan them if the quality is bad or the file is lost. And the fact of having the physical image is what makes it feel so special.

And the other thing that has made me love analog photography, is the fact that gifting a photograph to someone feels really authentic and a sign of care for that person. While both type of photographs can be gifted, there's something different when doing it so from an analog negative.

| Digital printing | Analog printing |
|------------------|-----------------|
| Take the picture | Buy a roll and load it |
| Develop it in Lightroom | Take the picture |
| Print it | Develop the negative **AFTER** using the whole roll |
| Frame it | Test how to print the photo (analog Lightroom) |
| Gift it | Enlarge (print) the negative |
|  | Frame the print |
|  | Gift it |

This could be the workflow to gift someone a picture you've taken. And even though both end up with a very personal gift, I think the second one has a lot more of work put into it. Developing film is not easy, printing it neither, there's equipment and chemicals involved along with quite some amount of time. I hope not to sound too biased, but I just love analog photography and what it means. I don't think it's superior at all, but it is certainly different and more to my liking, while still loving digital photography and its applications.
